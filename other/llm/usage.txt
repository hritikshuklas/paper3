Given factor levels of ("Biden" , "Trump") for our outcome variable, does a negative coefficient increase probabiltiy for Biden or Trump?

ChatGPT
In logistic regression, the sign of the coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship between the predictor variable and the log-odds of the outcome variable being in the "success" category, which in this case is "Biden" (coded as 1) versus "Trump" (coded as 0).

A negative coefficient means that as the predictor variable increases, the log-odds of the outcome variable being in the "success" category decrease. In the context of your outcome variable with levels "Biden" and "Trump," a negative coefficient would increase the probability of the outcome variable being "Biden" relative to "Trump."

Here's a simplified explanation:

Negative Coefficient:
Increases the log-odds of the outcome variable being in the category represented by the reference level (in this case, "Biden").
Decreases the log-odds of the outcome variable being in the other category (in this case, "Trump").
Therefore, if you have a logistic regression model with a negative coefficient for a predictor variable, it suggests that the predictor variable increases the probability of the outcome variable being "Biden" rather than "Trump."

Given log odds of 0.051, find probability in R

ChatGPT
To find the probability from the given log odds of 0.051 in R, you can use the logistic function. Here's how you can do it:

R
Copy code
# Given log odds
log_odds <- 0.051

# Calculate probability using the logistic function
probability <- 1 / (1 + exp(-log_odds))

# Print the probability
print(probability)
When you run this code, it will calculate the probability corresponding to the given log odds and print the result. The logistic function converts the log odds into a probability between 0 and 1.
